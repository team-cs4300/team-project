      <p> I’m Mawunyo Avegnon. I am from West Africa Ghana. A Computer Science Student at University of Houston Downtown. Growing up I wanted to become a doctor but changed my mind since I was not passionate about it. Plus, I didn’t want to be in school for that long but thinking about it I would’ve graduated if I pursued that course. I have always been fascinated about how computer works but never thought about going into it until I lost interest in pursuing a degree in Petroleum Engineering.  I Started my degree plan back in 2018 and I’m enjoying it so far. I hope to finish sometime in 2021. Once I’m done, I want to work as a Software Engineer or Cyber Security Analysist.  For now, my country is behind technological advancement compare to the western world. So, it is also my desire to one day take my knowledge and experience back home to help the upcoming generation to think about how to move the country into a digital world that can compete on the global arena. During my downtime, I like to read and watch movies. My hobbies also include working out, playing soccer, riding four wheelers and fixing stuff around the house. </p>
